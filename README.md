# spwla / .spt file converter spooler file well log data 
Spwla file converter that converts porosity and core gamma ray data to excel files: Handles also line based spwla spt files

This excels VBA macro  reads 98% of the old .spwla , spt files that  were used in various variants to record core porosity and permeability data in the North Sea (Uk/ Norway).
It also converts the core gamma ray to an easy readable excel file.
Should the conversion fail it is most often because the break line commands are unconventional . you can inspect and fix this in notepad++

all norwegian public core porosity and permeability data (1400 wells) can be downloaded here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dUTsx1AvqGzqMTv9FFjgJspv5V-9DfOU
