# spwla file converter
Spwla file converter that converts porosity and core gamma ray data to excel files: Handles also line based spwla files

This excels VBA macro  reads 98% of the old .spwla files that  were used in various variants to record core porosity and permeability data in the North Sea (Uk/ Norway).
It also converts the core gamma ray to an easy readable excel file.
Should the conversion fail it is most often because the break line commands are unconventional . you can expect and fix this in notepad++
